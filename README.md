# Azure_CV
My CV as a static web page :)

Built following the ACG project video, I learnt how to build a static site, integrated into GitHub and hosted on Microsoft Azure with Blob Storage, Azure Functions and CosmosDB. 

Tools used to build the site: 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- .NET
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Cosmos DB serverless database.
